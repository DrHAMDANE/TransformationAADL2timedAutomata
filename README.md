# TransformationAADL2timedAutomata
In this work, we propose an approach for the veriﬁcation of the AADL (Architecture and Analysis Design Language) description. This approach is based in Model Driven Engineering (MDE) and assisted by a toolchain. Indeed, we deﬁne a source meta-model for AADL and a target meta-model for the timed automata formalism; we deﬁne a transformation process in two steps : the ﬁrst is aModel2Model transformation which takes an AADLModel and produces the corresponding timed automata model. The second transformation is a Model2Text transformation which takes a timed automata model and generates a text in ta-format code. This code is accepted by the Uppaal toolbox. The goal of this effort is to insure some properties of AADL models using the Uppaal model checker. A case study has been developed to show the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach.
